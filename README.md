 /># Automated grant disburser

## 📌 Project Description
The **Automated Grant Disburser** is a blockchain-based system designed to streamline and automate the distribution of grant funds. It ensures transparency, security, and accountability by allowing grant creation, approval, and on-chain disbursement through a smart contract.

## 🎯 Project Vision
To simplify and automate the grant distribution process using decentralized technologies. The goal is to eliminate intermediaries, reduce processing delays, and ensure that funds reach the rightful recipients with complete transparency.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Grant Creation:** Admin can add new grant requests with recipient details and requested amount.
- **Approval Workflow:** Grants must be approved before disbursement, ensuring proper oversight.
- **Automated Payouts:** Smart contract ensures approved recipients automatically receive the correct funds.
- **Immutable Audit Trail:** All actions are recorded on-chain for accountability.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add multi-admin support with role-based permissions.
- Integrate milestone-based staged disbursements.
- Enable decentralized grant approvals via DAO voting.
- Add analytics dashboard for grant tracking.
- Integrate with stablecoins rather than raw ETH for predictable payouts.
